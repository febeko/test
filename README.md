## Problem Statement

This dashboard analyzes commercial airline flight data in India to understand how various factors affect flight ticket prices, identify pricing trends, and detect outliers across different routes, airlines, and classes.

Key Questions:

How does the number of days left before departure influence flight prices?

Which airlines offer more cost-effective pricing on average?

How do flight class and number of stops impact ticket costs?

Are there any unusual or extreme price outliers?

Which routes are most common, and what are their price dynamics?

Goal:
Build a visual, interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover actionable insights that can inform:

Customer flight booking strategies

Airline pricing policy evaluation

Travel budget planning tools


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "Arrival Delay".

### Insight: Average Flight Price by Airline
Airlines like Air India and Vistara tend to charge higher average prices.

Budget carriers like SpiceJet and AirAsia are on the lower end of the price spectrum.

- Step 15 : New measure was created to find total count of customers.

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
        Count of Customers = COUNT(airline_passenger_satisfaction[ID])
        
A card visual was used to represent count of customers.

 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  % of customers,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
         % Customers = (DIVIDE(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.

 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total distance travelled by flights & a card visual was used to represent total distance.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Total Distance Travelled = SUM(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Flight Distance])
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.
